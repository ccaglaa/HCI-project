We aim to observe the gap between complex routines and low effort realities (fatigue, travel limitations) by designing an interactive system that reduces the friction between desire for skin health and daily constraints.

## Built With
* **Vue.js 3** (The framework)
* **Vite** (The build tool)
* **CSS Variables** (The design system)

## Project Structure
* `src/components/` - Vue components for each section (Personas, Interviews, etc.)
* `public/` - Static assets (Images, PDFs)
* `dist/` - Production build (Auto-generated)

# The process 

### 1. User research 
We conducted interviews with 6 different people of varying ages (15–54) and nationalities (French, Turkish, Romanian, Lithuanian, Chinese). The goal was to understand their current skincare habits, frustrations, and motivations, ranging from elaborate multiple step rituals to minimal or non existent routines. 

### 2. Interaction Points 
We extracted specific moments where users interact with their products or environment to identify friction. Key points included the "drying time" gap that leads to forgotten steps, the "carry-on rejection" where travel limits force users to abandon products, and the "price shock" that drives users to cheaper alternatives or giving up entirely.

### 3. Personas 
We synthesized our findings into three archetypes to guide design decisions:
* **Emily:** A young adult and skincare enthusiast who enjoys the process but struggles with travel logistics and time management.
* **Thomas:** An efficiency focused user who avoids complex steps and only acts when skin issues arise.
* **Nara:** Our extreme persona. An influencer and power user who hoards products but struggles with consistency and waste. 

### 4. Scenarios 
We created narrative storyboards involving all three personas to contextualize their struggles. The scenario illustrated how a single social media post triggers different reactions (research vs. ignoring) and how travel disrupts their routines differently (packing chaos vs. leaving everything behind)

### Brainstorming, Dimensions & Design Space 
We generated around 50 ideas, ranging from "all-in-one" smart razors to virtual beauty lenses. We then mapped these ideas onto a Design Space defined by key dimensions such as interaction/effort, cost (subscription), size, side effects, duration, ethical or not, comfort and resources to identify gaps and select the most promising concept for our prototype.
